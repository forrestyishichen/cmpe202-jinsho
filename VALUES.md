Simplicity: we will do what is needed and asked for, but no more. This will maximize the value created by the investment made to date. We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. We will create something we are proud of and maintain it long term for reasonable costs. After the discussion in this week, we decided to implement the application by using JavaScript Game Engine. We hope to develop a game which is similar to Super Mario. Right now we are learning the tutorial in JS.

I select Feedback as the XP Core Values I will focus on this project. I will keep a journal of how the team kept this value throughout the project. Report this on a weekly basis by maintaining a Personal Project Log Wiki Page on [ nguyensjsu/cmpe202-jinsho](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/cmpe202-jinsho).

The aims of XP Feedback is to take every iteration commitment seriously by delivering working software, to demonstrate software early, listen carefully, and make any changes needed and to talk about the project and adapt the process to it, not the other way around. Javascript is a high-level, dynamic, object-based programming language, mostly for web development. The game project requires web base; therefore, we will use Javascript syntax as our main project coding language, and debugging language to implement frameworks and any feature requests.

I will glad to pick “communication” as my core agile value throughout the term project exercise this semester. Extreme Programming does not depend on extensive documentation. As a matter of fact, extreme programming documentation is suggested only when necessary. So the methodology relies heavily on communication between team members and also with the users. We will have a weekly team meeting during the entire project session. Instead of heavily relay on communicate through Github documentation, we will fully take the advantages of face to face communication during team meeting. A good communication ensure a good understanding of everyone's work. We will keep this as a good exercise till the end of semester.

We will use javascript syntax to implement our 3D Unity game. There are a couple of reasons that we choose Unity:
1. It is **FREE**. Unity3D has a free version which is feature-complete. We can create the game without the obstacle of the price.
2. It is multi-platform.
3. The asset store. We do not have to make the game from scratch.
4. We can script in Unity using Javascript.
5. The ability to create multiplayer games.

As getting familiar with the structure and design of the engine, we will be always updating the game with the features applied.

We have a prototype for our Unity 3D Game. However, just rolling a ball is boring. We are taking a deep look into the Unity framework and will work on a more amazing game.

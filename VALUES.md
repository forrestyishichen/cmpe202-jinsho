Simplicity: we will do what is needed and asked for, but no more. This will maximize the value created by the investment made to date. We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. We will create something we are proud of and maintain it long term for reasonable costs. After the discussion in this week, we decided to implement the application by using JavaScript Game Engine. We hope to develop a game which is similar to Super Mario. Right now we are learning the tutorial in JS. 

**Yilin Miao:**

I select Feedback as my XP Core Value I will focus on this project. I will keep a journal of how the team kept this value throughout the project. Report this on a weekly basis by maintaining a Personal Project Log Wiki Page on [ nguyensjsu/cmpe202-jinsho](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/cmpe202-jinsho).

The aims of XP Feedback is to take every iteration commitment seriously by delivering working software, to demonstrate software early, listen carefully, and make any changes needed and to talk about the project and adapt the process to it, not the other way around. Javascript is a high-level, dynamic, object-based programming language, mostly for web development. The game project requires web base; therefore, we will use Javascript syntax as our main project coding language, and debugging language to implement frameworks and any feature requests. 

**Yishi Chen:**

I will glad to pick “communication” as my core agile value throughout the term project exercise this semester. Extreme Programming does not depend on extensive documentation. As a matter of fact, extreme programming documentation is suggested only when necessary. So the methodology relies heavily on communication between team members and also with the users. We will have a weekly team meeting during the entire project session. Instead of heavily rely on communicating through Github documentation, we will fully take the advantages of face to face communication during the team meeting. A good communication ensure a good understanding of everyone's work. We will keep this as a good exercise till the end of the semester.

We will use javascript syntax to implement our 3D Unity game. There are a couple of reasons that we choose Unity:
1. It is **FREE**. Unity3D has a free version which is feature-complete. We can create the game without the obstacle of the price.
2. It is multi-platform.
3. The asset store. We do not have to make the game from scratch.
4. We can script in Unity using Javascript.
5. The ability to create multiplayer games.

As getting familiar with the structure and design of the engine, we will be always updating the game with the features applied.

**Yishi Chen:**

Based on this week's communication, we have decided to pick javascript as our implementation language over java. The reason behind is our project is a Dynamic single page application (SPAs). Some very typical javascript features such as interpreted language, dynamic type checking, and prototype-based will help us to build a small application much more efficiently.

We have a prototype for our Unity 3D Game. However, just rolling a ball is boring. We are taking a deep look into the Unity framework and will work on a more amazing game.

**Yishi Chen:**

Based on this week's communication and team demo during the meeting, Yilin Miao provided us an amazing tutorial of unity javascript. We are pretty confident to start our implementation after the midterm.

### 10/14/2017: 

In this week's meeting, we discussed the current difficulty of our project and what kind of new functions should be added to our project.

**Yilin Miao:**

We have a prototype for melonjs Game. We will work on a more amazing game. I realized Feedback, **the XP Core Value**, is really essential to be utilized in a team project. This reflects on how we choose techniques to realize the ideas or the requirements. So far, we did not do very well with the feedback, since we just decided our techniques. We will work on it.

**Yishi Chen:**

Based on this week's communication and team meeting, we have collected some more material and knowledge of our whole project process.

### 10/21/2017: 

In this week's meeting, we discussed the current difficulty of our project and what kind of new functions should be added to our project. 

**Yilin Miao:**

We started developing our first melonjs Game. The Feedback, **the XP Core Value**, is we are in progress but not very fast. Team members are new to the techniques so it takes time to get familiar with code with melonjs, and use its framework. This reflects on how we implementing the features and base model of the game. So far, we are struggling with the game development. We are working on finding a solution.

**Yishi Chen:**

I would like to pick **courage** as this week's xp value. Based on team's decides, we have choose molenjs as project framework and start to dig into it. Each of our team member are courage enough to try out some different type of example and we will find our target game type. 

## 10/28/2017:

In this week's meeting, we have move on and start to work on our first version.

**Yishi Chen**

I would like to pick **communicatation** as my value this week. We have decided our game domain as a japan sushi resturant because we communicate efficiently during the meeting


**Jingduo Huang**
I will choose communications as my value in this week. I checked more than 40 games sample online this week. Because we want to get inspired from those gamse so that we can add fun functions to our game. After discussed with our teammates, we decided our game theme.
